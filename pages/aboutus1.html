                Your new furniture has been manufactured to our exacting standards. We are so confident in our workmanship
                 and materials, that we offer a Lifetime Warranty on workmanship, frame, all springs, and seating foam. 
                 (Any swivel rocker base is warranted for one year, sleeper mechanisms and recliner mechanisms for a period
                  of three years for residential use.)<br/><br/>
                  
            
                If you have a problem, simply notify the dealer from whom you purchased the furniture. Justice Furniture agrees
                 to repair the problem, without charge, except for transportation cost. We can normally pick up at the dealer’s
                  place of business for no charge and usually return it within 10 weeks.<br/><br/>
           
                We reserve the right to substitute materials or products of equal quality. To qualify for repair, the furniture
                 must be in good condition except for the structural defect to be remedied, and not otherwise damaged. 
                 This warranty extends only to original purchaser.<br/><br/>
                 No other warranty exists, either implied or expressed. Some states do not allow limitations or exclusions 
                 on implied warranties, so these limitations may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, 
                 and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.<br/><br/>
            
                No standard warranty exists for fabrics. Justice does, however, monitor fabric quality in-plant and buys from 
                reputable fabric mills only. Caution: After-market treatments, stain repellents, steam cleaning and over-use 
                of fabric fresheners will accelerate wear and are not recommended by fabric mills.<br/><br/>

                 To find the “Cleanability Code”, look on the deck tag located under the seat cushions.<br/><br/>

                 S - Clean with pure petroleum distillate-based solvents only. (A water- or detergent-based solvent cleaner
                  may cause excessive shrinkage. Stains from water may become permanent.)<br/><br/>

                SW - Clean with either water-based cleaning agents, foam, or pure petroleum distillate-based solvents.<br/><br/>

                W - Clean with water-based cleaning agents or foam to remove overall soil. (Note: household cleaners can
                 be harmful to the color and life of fabric.)<br/><br/>

                X - Clean only by vacuuming or light brushing. (Cleaning agents of any kind may cause excessive shrinking or fading.)
